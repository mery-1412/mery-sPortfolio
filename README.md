# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer and designer.

## Overview

This portfolio is built with modern web technologies to create a fast, responsive, and visually appealing showcase of my work. It features a clean design, smooth animations, and an intuitive user experience.


## Technologies Used

This portfolio leverages several modern technologies to deliver a great user experience:

- **Frontend**: React.js for component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

## Customization

Creating new sections is straightforward - add new components in the components directory and import them into the main App component.

## Performance

The portfolio is built with performance in mind:
